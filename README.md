### React DevTools

For a better development experience, install the React DevTools browser extension:

- [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi)
- [Firefox Extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/react-devtools/)

After installing the extension, restart your browser and development server. This will eliminate the console message and provide powerful tools for inspecting and debugging your React components.
