🔮 Forecasting trends with simple statistical models (e.g., Moving Averages)
🎨 Clean, responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
⚛️ Modern React + Vite frontend architecture
⚙️ Modular component design with TypeScript and Context API
🧪 Ready for testing, CI/CD, and production deployment
🔁 End-to-End Workflow

1. Project Initialization
Tool: Vite
Purpose: Scaffolds a high-performance React application with zero-config setup.
Highlights: Lightning-fast dev server, optimized production builds, instant HMR.

3. Version Control
Tool: Git + GitHub
Purpose: Enables collaborative development, branching, and deployment workflows.
Usage: Tracks changes, handles pull requests, and integrates CI/CD.

5. Development Setup
Tools:
React DevTools (debugging)
ESLint & Prettier (linting & formatting)
TypeScript (type safety)
Benefits: Improved code quality, developer productivity, and maintainability.

7. Core App Development
Architecture: Modular, component-driven React design
State Management: React Context API for global state (e.g., theme, preferences)
Data Integration:
Real-time & historical data via Alpha Vantage API
Secure API keys via .env configuration
Clear setup instructions in API-SETUP.md

9. Forecasting Engine
Approach: Implements simple algorithms like moving averages to project future trends.
Purpose: Offers basic analytical insight and introduces machine learning concepts.
Educational Value: Demonstrates data processing and trend estimation on the frontend.

11. UI & Styling
Tool: Tailwind CSS
Advantages: Utility-first, mobile-responsive, and consistent styling out-of-the-box.

13. Testing & Debugging
Methods:
Manual testing in-browser
State inspection with React DevTools
Optional: Jest or React Testing Library for unit tests
Goal: Ensure stability, correctness, and UX polish.

15. Build Optimization
Process:
Vite bundles and minifies for production.
Lightweight, performant, and fast-loading build output.

17. Deployment
Platforms: Netlify or Vercel
Workflow: Connect GitHub repo → Auto-deploy on push → Preview builds
Benefits: Custom domains, CI/CD, rollback support.
